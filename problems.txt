We have different shipping containers in our warehouse, we need to be able to
manage them efficiently.

We have 3 main types of containers -that will be increased - normal boxes, cold
boxes and bags. For the boxes, it is important to know the hight, width and
depth. For the bags, besides hight and width, weight is important.

The warehouse operator need to know the following at any moment:
Store new containers after in the system once they are delivered to the
warehouse.
How many containers are in the warehouse of each type
Ship any container to a customer, for boxes, using a car, for bags using a
bike.

Since the department is new, the container model is likely to change next year.
